\begin{abstract}
Brain Computer Interfaces (BCI) are closed loop systems used to control the operation of devices such as a wheelchair, or a robot arm, as well as in games as the user interface. The ability of a BCI system in detecting correctly the user’s intent depends on parameters such as the classification algorithm, the number and position of EEG electrodes used and the frequency bands examined. The aim of this project is to investigate the ability of a BCI system to detect EEG signals, recorded with the use of a single electrode attached on the Fp1 position. The frequency band examined is the alpha band (8Hz to 12Hz) with more emphasis at the 10Hz peaks.


A number of experiments were devised to be conducted with the help of a number of willing persons acting as the subjects. This however, requires a prior approval by the Ethics Committee of the University. Because this approval was not granted on time, the signals used for the analysis of the EEG activity are taken from EEG recordings of the author of this report only. For the purpose of this project the conscious signal is considered to be the EEG signal recorded during the time that the subject is concentrating on the mental activity specified by the experiment. The EEG background noise is the EEG signal recorded when the subject is relaxed. The subject was instructed to avoid any movements that could create artefacts. 


The spectrum of the recorded signals was examined in order to investigate the behaviour of the 10Hz peaks. From the processed EEG signals it was verified that the 10Hz are indeed present, while the frequency of the peaks shifts slightly between 9Hz and 11Hz. Furthermore, it was observed that the power of these peaks varies according to the mental effort of the subject. The SNR of the recorded signals was then calculated and compared to threshold noise levels called the noise walls. The values of this SNR noise walls were computed in another project conducted 2018. The investigation of the SNR showed that the calculated SNR was higher than the “relax” and the “Sudoku” SNR walls, while It was lower for the “eye blinking” artefact, thus the investigated BCI system can detect the EEG signals, while care must be  taken in handling artefacts.
